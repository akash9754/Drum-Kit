# 🎵 Music Kit - Single Page Website

A fun single-page web app where you can play different music tracks by pressing keys: `a, s, d, f, g, h, j, k, l`.

Each key plays a different sound, giving you a musical experience right from your keyboard!

- Lightweight and super-fast loading.
- Simple and beginner-friendly project to understand DOM events and audio controls.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- This project uses:
  - **HTML** for the page structure.
  - **CSS** for basic styling.
  - **JavaScript** to handle keypress events and play sounds.

- When a user presses any of the specified keys, a corresponding `.mp3` (or `.wav`) sound file is played instantly.
